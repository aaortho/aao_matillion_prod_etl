# Project Context

This file helps Maia understand your specific project needs and requirements.

## Please include things like:
- Business context and objectives
- Warehouse naming conventions and standards
- Transformation rules and patterns
- Data source descriptions and characteristics
- Team-specific workflows

Context files are project and branch specific, stored in the `.matillion/maia/rules/` directory.
